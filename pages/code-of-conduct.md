## If there is a problem

If you are troubled by the behaviour of another attendee at the conference, or are concerned that another attendee may be in distress, please speak immediately to any member of conference staff.

Your concern will be heard in confidence and taken seriously.

Conference staff - volunteers and organisers - will be on hand throughout the conference. Any concern, whatever it is, will be immediately passed on to a member of the conference committee.

The committee will investigate promptly and if necessary will take appropriate action.
