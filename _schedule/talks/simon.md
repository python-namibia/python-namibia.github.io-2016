MomConnect is an open source mobile health system aimed at improving maternal health services at a national scale.

It was initially launched a year ago in South Africa, where it is now the national pregnancy registration system, with over 685 000 women registered. This represents 68% of all recorded births. MomConnect is currently in the process of being launched in Uganda and Nigeria.

MomConnect is a fairly complex system that includes:

* Registration

* Thrice-weekly SMSes to mothers with maternal health information relevant to the current stage of their pregnancy or age of their new born child.

* Integration with the national health information system.

* A help desk for reporting and triaging problems with MomConnect, clinics or the national health service.

It has averted at least one national health crisis.

Many of its components are built with Python, Django & Twisted.

This talk will give a brief tour of the MomConnect system explaining why various pieces were built, how they help address the maternal health challenges in South Africa and the challenges we face in launching it in other countries.
