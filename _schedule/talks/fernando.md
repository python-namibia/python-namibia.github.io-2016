In her keynote at PyConUS 2014, Jessica McKellar issued a challenge: to do one thing that would promote the next generation of Python programmers.

*Python for Zombies Massive open online course* is my personal response, and my contribution to the next Brazilian Python Generation.

I'll discuss:

* how it differs from other Massive open online courses (*MOOCs*), and the special challenges we face in Brazil
* how we did it, and what we achieved
* some notable examples
* where we're going next
