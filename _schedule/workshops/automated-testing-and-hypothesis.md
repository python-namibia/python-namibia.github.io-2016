A tutorial on Python automated testing and Hypothesis. We'll do a number of
worked examples introducing the basics of py.test and how to use Hypothesis
with it. We'll go through a series of problems and work through solutions and
how best to test them to help us be confident in their correctness.

At the end of the session attendees will have a better concept of how to use
Hypothesis to test their code, and hopefully how to write correct code in
general.

Basic familiarity with Python is needed for this course, and if you have no
familiarity with automated testing at all parts of it may go a bit fast, but
this is a beginner friendly course.
